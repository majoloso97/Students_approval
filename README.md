# Students_approval
This repository contains the experimenting and production implementation of a classification machine learning model developed to predict the approval of students in their 1st university cycle. 

The study was based on a dataset which contained general data, study habits survey and psycho-pedagogical test results from students of the 1st cycle of a university from El Salvador. This data was preprocessed by the University to whom the data belongs, to remove any sensible or personal data that could identify individuals. 

The experimental part of the project involved the use of scikit-learn and pandas to develop the model pipeline. Once finished, the model obtained an accuracy of %, which was considered satisfactory. Then, the serialized .pkl file was used for a production implementation using the streamlit api.
